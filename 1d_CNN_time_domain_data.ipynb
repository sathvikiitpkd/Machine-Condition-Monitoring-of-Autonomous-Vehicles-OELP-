    "### SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHNIQUES\n",
    "Signal processing plays a significant role in building condition monitoring system. Many types of signals can\n",
    "be used in the condition monitoring of machines, such as vibration signals as in this research; and processing these signals in an appropriate way is crucial in extracting the most salient features related to different fault types. A number of signal processing techniques can fulfil this purpose, and the nature of the captured signal is a significant factor in the selection of the appropriate technique.Some of the signal processing techniques are Spectrogram and MEL Spectrum.\n",
    "### Spectrogram\n",
    "Spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. When\n",
    "applied to an audio signal, spectrograms are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams.Spectrograms\n",
    "are used extensively in the fields of sonar, radar, speech processing, seismology, and others.From Spectrogram, the signal is analyzed to determine any substantial frequencies coming from the machine’s components.\n",
    "### MEL Spectrum\n",
    "A Mel spectrogram logarithmically renders frequencies within a certain range of frequencies. Mel spectrograms are\n",
    "better suited for applications that need to model human hearing perception. Here, we find it easier to distinguish between similar low frequency sounds than similar high frequency sounds.It is computed by applying a Fourier transform to analyze the frequency content of a signal and to convert it to the mel-scale"

It has become a rapidly growing research direction, redefining state-of-the-art performances in a wide range of areas such as object recognition, image segmentation, speech recognition and machine translation.Data collection,feature extraction and fault identification are typical steps in condition monitoring of a mechanical systems. Conventional approaches in condition monitoring extract features from time and frequency domain of raw signals.\n",

    "LSTM has a strong ability, can learn sequence data without manual extraction of complex features, and has well built-in capabilities of handling complex high dimensional massive data.

    "### DataSet Description :\n",
    "The data contain vibration signals collected from bearings of different health conditions under time-varying rotational speed conditions. There are 60 datasets in total. For each dataset, there are two experimental settings: bearing health condition and varying speed condition. The health conditions of the bearing include (i) healthy, (ii) faulty with an inner race defect, (iii) faulty with an outer race defect, (iv) faulty with a ball defect, and (v) faulty with combined defects on the inner race, the outer race and a ball. The operating rotational speed conditions are (i) increasing speed, (ii) decreasing speed, (iii) increasing then decreasing speed, and (iv) decreasing then increasing speed. Therefore, there are 20 different cases for the setting. To ensure the authenticity of the data, 3 trials are collected for each experimental setting which results in 60 datasets in total. Each dataset contains two channels: 'Channel1' is vibration data measured by the accelerometer and 'Channel2' is the rotational speed data measured by the encoder. All these data are sampled at 200,000Hz and the sampling duration is 10 seconds. The CPR (Cycles Per Revolution) of the encoder is 1024.\n",
